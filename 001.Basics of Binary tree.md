A Binary Tree Data Structure is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. It is commonly used in computer science for efficient storage and retrieval of data, with various operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

This restriction, that a node can have a maximum of two child nodes, gives us many benefits:
- Algorithms like traversing, searching, insertion and deletion become easier to understand, to implement, and run faster.
- Keeping data sorted in a Binary Search Tree (BST) makes searching very efficient.
- Balancing trees is easier to do with a limited number of child nodes, using an AVL Binary Tree for example.
- Binary Trees can be represented as arrays, making the tree more memory efficient.

A parent node, or internal node, in a Binary Tree is a node with one or two child nodes.

The left child node is the child node to the left.

The right child node is the child node to the right.

The tree height is the maximum number of edges from the root node to a leaf node.

## Binary Trees vs Arrays and Linked Lists
- Benefits of Binary Trees over Arrays and Linked Lists:

Arrays are fast when you want to access an element directly, like element number 700 in an array of 1000 elements for example. But inserting and deleting elements require other elements to shift in memory to make place for the new element, or to take the deleted elements place, and that is time consuming.
Linked Lists are fast when inserting or deleting nodes, no memory shifting needed, but to access an element inside the list, the list must be traversed, and that takes time.
Binary Trees, such as Binary Search Trees and AVL Trees, are great compared to Arrays and Linked Lists because they are BOTH fast at accessing a node, AND fast when it comes to deleting or inserting a node, with no shifts in memory needed.
We will take a closer look at how Binary Search Trees (BSTs) and AVL Trees work on the next two pages, but first let's look at how a Binary Tree can be implemented, and how it can be traversed.

## Types of Binary Trees
There are different variants, or types, of Binary Trees worth discussing to get a better understanding of how Binary Trees can be structured.

The different kinds of Binary Trees are also worth mentioning now as these words and concepts will be used later in the tutorial.

Below are short explanations of different types of Binary Tree structures, and below the explanations are drawings of these kinds of structures to make it as easy to understand as possible.

- A balanced Binary Tree has at most 1 in difference between its left and right subtree heights, for each node in the tree.

- A complete Binary Tree has all levels full of nodes, except the last level, which is can also be full, or filled from left to right. The properties of a complete Binary Tree means it is also balanced.

- A full Binary Tree is a kind of tree where each node has either 0 or 2 child nodes.

- A perfect Binary Tree has all leaf nodes on the same level, which means that all levels are full of nodes, and all internal nodes have two child nodes.The properties of a perfect Binary Tree means it is also full, balanced, and complete.

## Binary Tree Traversal
Going through a Tree by visiting every node, one node at a time, is called traversal.

Since Arrays and Linked Lists are linear data structures, there is only one obvious way to traverse these: start at the first element, or node, and continue to visit the next until you have visited them all.

But since a Tree can branch out in different directions (non-linear), there are different ways of traversing Trees.

There are two main categories of Tree traversal methods:

Breadth First Search (BFS) is when the nodes on the same level are visited before going to the next level in the tree. This means that the tree is explored in a more sideways direction.

Depth First Search (DFS) is when the traversal moves down the tree all the way to the leaf nodes, exploring the tree branch by branch in a downwards direction.

There are three different types of DFS traversals:
- pre-order
- in-order
- post-order

# Pre-order Traversal of Binary Trees
Pre-order Traversal is a type of Depth First Search, where each node is visited in a certain order.
Pre-order Traversal is done by visiting the root node first, then recursively do a pre-order traversal of the left subtree, followed by a recursive pre-order traversal of the right subtree. It's used for creating a copy of the tree, prefix notation of an expression tree, etc.

This traversal is "pre" order because the node is visited "before" the recursive pre-order traversal of the left and right subtrees.

This is how the code for pre-order traversal looks like:
```cpp
void preorder(Node * root) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return;
    }
    cout << root->data << endl;
    preorder(root->left);
    preorder(root->right);
}
```

# In-order Traversal of Binary Trees
In-order Traversal is a type of Depth First Search, where each node is visited in a certain order.
In-order Traversal does a recursive In-order Traversal of the left subtree, visits the root node, and finally, does a recursive In-order Traversal of the right subtree. This traversal is mainly used for Binary Search Trees where it returns values in ascending order.

What makes this traversal "in" order, is that the node is visited in between the recursive function calls. The node is visited after the In-order Traversal of the left subtree, and before the In-order Traversal of the right subtree.

This is how the code for In-order Traversal looks like:
```cpp
void inorder(Node * root) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return;
    }
    inorder(root->left);
    cout << root->data << endl;
    inorder(root->right);
}
```

# Post-order Traversal of Binary Trees
Post-order Traversal is a type of Depth First Search, where each node is visited in a certain order.
Post-order Traversal works by recursively doing a Post-order Traversal of the left subtree and the right subtree, followed by a visit to the root node. It is used for deleting a tree, post-fix notation of an expression tree, etc.

What makes this traversal "post" is that visiting a node is done "after" the left and right child nodes are called recursively.

This is how the code for Post-order Traversal looks like:
```cpp
void postorder(Node * root) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return;
    }
    postorder(root->left);
    postorder(root->right);
    cout << root->data << endl;
}
```

# Array Implementation of Binary Trees
To avoid the cost of all the shifts in memory that we get from using Arrays, it is useful to implement Binary Trees with pointers from one element to the next, just like Binary Trees are implemented before this point, especially when the Binary Tree is modified often.

But in case we read from the Binary Tree a lot more than we modify it, an Array implementation of a Binary Tree can make sense as it needs less memory, it can be easier to implement, and it can be faster for certain operations due to cache locality.

Cache Locality is when the fast cache memory in the computer stores parts of memory that was recently accessed, or when the cache stores parts of memory that is close to the address that is currently accessed. This happens because it is likely that the CPU needs something in the next cycle that is close to what it used in the previous cycle, either close in time or close in space.

Since Array elements are stored contiguously in memory, one element right after the other, computers are sometimes faster when reading from Arrays because the next element is already cached, available for fast access in case the CPU needs it in the next cycle.

How arrays are stored in memory is explained more in detail here.
